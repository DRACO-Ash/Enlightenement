# Changelog: Enlightenment

One audit row per change: what changed, why, and how it was verified.

## V0.1 (2026-08-18)

**What.** First commit. The gate-compliant Python server skeleton: the `create_app(...)`
factory, env-only validated configuration, constant-time shared-token authentication,
two-tier rate limiting, fail-closed CORS, split liveness and readiness paths with a
real-write storage probe behind a hard timeout, a secret-free diagnostics read-out, one
structured JSON audit line per privileged action, an atomic anti-shrink JSON store with
schema version and pre-write backups, hash-locked dependencies, a flattened hardened
Dockerfile pinned by digest, quality-gate scoping, and the verification loop, packaging,
and pipeline-simulation scripts.

**Why.** The Foundations baseline ships standards, not a starter application, and the App
Store contract is cheapest to satisfy at scaffold time. Retrofitting it costs one upload
cycle per pipeline stage, because the platform reveals its requirements one gate at a time.

**How verified.** `ruff format --check` and `ruff check` clean across 23 selected rule
families (`python3 -c "import tomllib,pathlib;print(len(tomllib.loads(pathlib.Path('pyproject.toml').read_text())['tool']['ruff']['lint']['select']))"`);
`mypy` strict clean over 11 source files; 126 tests collected (125 passed, 1 skipped) with branch coverage at
97.60% against an 80% floor, Cobertura written to `coverage.xml`; `pip-audit` against the hash-locked
runtime requirements; the pipeline simulation green against the actual upload artefact in
the platform's environment (`GITLAB_CI=true`, its generated pipeline file present). Eight
mutants across the security controls were each confirmed to turn a named test red.

**Not verified here.** The container image build and the image policy posture. A Docker
daemon was started successfully, but the registry's blob endpoint is denied by the authoring
environment's network policy, so no base-image layer can be pulled and the Dockerfile is
neither proved nor disproved. `scripts/build-image.sh` distinguishes an unreachable registry
from a rejected Dockerfile and exits 3 with a "deferred to CI" banner rather than reporting a
pass; the CI `image` job is the binding check. One finding did come out of the attempt: the
`# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` frontend directive was removed, because it makes the builder
fetch an external frontend image before reading any instruction, and the App Store runner sits
behind a registry mirror with no guaranteed public route. Every feature used is in BuildKit's
built-in frontend.

**Open with the project owner.** The training scenario vocabulary (`scenario` is an open,
length-capped string rather than an invented enumeration), the App Store category and
visibility, and the resource budget.
